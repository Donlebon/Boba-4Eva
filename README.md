# Insight

This web application was inspired by my passion for drinking boba. I love trying different drinks and visiting new cafes weekly. However, if I've visited a cafe multiple times, I always forget which 
drinks I've tried previously and which I liked/disliked. Thus, Boba 4Eva was born! (Name is still in progress...)
