This project highlights interacting with the movie API and using a browser's local storage to be able to save the user's movie choices.

# Lessons Learned:

This project served as a good beginning point to transition into more complex applications. The client's input is used to fetch data from an API. The returned promised data is a list of movies that contains the client's keywords. The browser's local storage acts like a database where we can store the user's favorite movies and also remove them from the list.
